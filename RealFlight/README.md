# Setting up RealFlight



More general instructions for using RealFlight with ArduPilot [here](https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/sitl-with-realflight.html).

I have also included the Blender model used to create the RealFlight graphics, you can probably tell there is something wrong with the texture map, it looks all shiny. If anyone fancy's doing a better job that would be great!
